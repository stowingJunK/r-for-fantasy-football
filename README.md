### Foreword
For anyone that has seen the movie, Moneyball, or was fan of the famous 2002 Oakland Athletics team, you've witnessed the strength of numbers, data, and statistical analysis. As a student of chemical engineering who had to capture stories based on a plethora of data from various labs and projects, the importance of data always resonated with me. This influence of numbers reinforced further as an intern in the environmental sector working with datasets which would ultimately impact policy-making. Having already learned MATLAB and Python, I decided to expand my knowledge of data manipulation and exploration by learning R. As a result, I created this repository, a breathing project, to practice and document my journey, using NFL fantasy football data as the focal point.
