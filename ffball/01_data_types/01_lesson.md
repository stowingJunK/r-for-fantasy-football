# Data Types
This section provides the goundwork for solving any problems using R. Without an understanding of the various data types, one will have difficulty coding in R.


## Objects
In R, there are five basic or "atomic" classes of objects. 
* Character
* Numeric (real numbers)
* Integer
* Complex
* Logical

### Numeric
Numeric objects are used to represent decimal values in R. An example of a numeric object is `7` or `3`. This is also the default computational data type.

### Integer
Integer objects are 
```r
x <- as.integer(10.5)
```

### Complex


### Character
Character objects are used to represent string values in R. Examples of a character object is `brady` or `foles`. 


### Logical
