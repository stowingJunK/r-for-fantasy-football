# Data Types
This section provides the goundwork for solving any problems using R. Without an understanding of the various data types, one will have difficulty coding in R. This section on *Data Types* gives a brief overview about different data structures in R, their attributes, and more.


## Objects
Similar to other computer languages, variables are the interface for accessing data in stored memory. Objects, or specialized data structures, are used in R to achieve this. Objects hold much more data than what's visible on the surface. For example, a variable can contain a value or set of values, but, as an object, it also holds information such as the type of data, the length of data, or other user-defined attributes. 

## Summary
In the next lesson, I dive deeper into the different types of attributes an object in R can possess.
