# Data Types

## Vectors
Now that you know the different classes of objects in R and the many attributes they can hold, we can begin exploring more complex objects. A majority of the objects we created in the previous sections contained only single values, but there were also a few vectors and matrices. This section talks about vectors, a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. Each value within a vector is called a component.
